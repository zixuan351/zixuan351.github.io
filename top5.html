  <h2>ðŸŒŸ My All-Time Favorite Anime</h2>
  <p><strong>My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU (Oregairu)</strong> has been my favorite anime for years. I love how it mixes dry humor, social awkwardness, and emotional depth through the story of Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui. The dialogue is sharp, the relationships are messy and real, and it speaks deeply to anyone whoâ€™s ever felt like they didnâ€™t fit in.</p>
